# How to Extend

- Add sensors: update enums, training data, model files, thresholds, and chart datasets.
- Protect routes: mark routes non-public in router meta and rely on the guard; enforce DRF permissions per view.
- Swap DB: update `DATABASES` in `agriculture_sys_project/settings.py` and run migrations.
